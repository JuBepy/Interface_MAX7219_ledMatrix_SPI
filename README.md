# Interface_MAX7219_ledMatrix_SPI
This GitHub is the result of a Hardware/Software course project. The project uses two main hardware components: the altera DE0 nano SoC golden and a led Matrix with a MAX7219 driving system

On this GitHub you will find :
- DE0-my_first_hps-fpga_base folder --> this folder contains a full example including the main.c file, Makefile, top, and Platform manager for DE0 nano. This helped us verify that we were coding correctly by downloading the project and view the .v and main.c files. Watch out that the names, C and Verilog are case sensitive and that the examples do not include IO pins.
- ****** --> It contains our work about testbenches and was inspired by this following GitHub : https://github.com/reedaj/VHDL-MAX7219-8x8-LED-Matrix-Controller
- ****** --> Inspired by *****, it helped us make the ledmatrix work and allowed us to produce the video linked bellow 




a readme file with a short description of the tutorial, group members (email), university link, course name, and year.
